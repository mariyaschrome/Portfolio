    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of coding I also enjoy:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Playing Violin</li>
        <img src="/assets/Violin.jpeg"/>
        <p>I have been playing violin since the age of 5. I originally got into it through my parents who insisted that I should begin nurturing my talents at a young age.
            Therefore, they signed me up for music classes where I started playing a bunch of different instruments but I engaged mostly since it was my favorite and most engaging.
        </p>
        <li>Miniature Construction</li>
        <img src="/assets/Gallery of Miniature Construction_ Modeling From Structure to Finish  - 1.jpeg"/>
        <p>When I was younger, I used to really enjoy helping my dad work on his projects from as simple as fixing the blown-up heater to installing a light switch,
            I found it fun. My Dad is an engineer so obviously from a young age, I knew that I wanted to be like him except I found it more fun to construct little houses
            from popsicle sticks or cardboard boxes around the house. I found it fun and eventually, it became a hobby.
        </p>
        <li>Fixing Engines</li>
        <img src="/assets/c53ad564-5ca1-490b-98e1-876c784cbef1.jpeg"/>
        <p>To be honest, there's always fun in learning new things especially when it's something difficult that not most people can do and for me that came about 
            whenever I'd lounge around my dad as he fixed up his or my mom's car in the garage. I'm a car enthusiast so obviously, I found it enticing to see how
            cars worked under the bonnet.
        </p>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <img src="/assets/Libros soft.jpeg"/>
        <p>Reading is fun in that it benefits you a lot. First of all, you're able to acquire new information and improve your vocabulary. Second of all,
            you are able to unlock a part of your imagination that allows you to engage with your books and experience what you're reading.
        </p>
        <li>Travelling</li>
        <img src="/assets/My 65 Best Travel Tips To Save Money & Travel Like A Pro!.jpeg"/>
        <p>I enjoy travelling to new places from time to time. I do this because it helps me meet new people and experience new cultures and way of life too.</p>
    </ol>

<section id="spirit-animal">
    <h2>Spirit Animal</h2>
    <p>I consider my spirit animal a Butterfly. This is because butterflies symbolize transformation, change, and rebirth.
       I am mostly inspired by the transformation of a caterpillar to butterfly in that there is beauty in change.
